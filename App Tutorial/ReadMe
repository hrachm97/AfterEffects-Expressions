This is a project of template based tutorial animation making tool. It's based on After Effects expressions. Standard animations are made with keyframes
and other modifying tools provided by the application, but this project is all made with expression codes which is controlled through a json file.
The shots.json file placed here is an instance of a real video 90% built with this automated system as a test.

The lacking part here is the frontend which can provide user friendly tools for making the video and generate the json file based on the input of the user.
